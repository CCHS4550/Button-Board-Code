# Button Board Code
Written in Circutpython for a Raspberry Pi Pico by Owen Lennon
<br/>
The red button board. One of my legacies to the team. 
<br/>
You shouldn't have to change anything, but if something happens the steps to reset the board go as follows.
1. Open the button board
2. Hold down the "bootsel" button on the raspberry pi pico
3. Plug the usb cable into a computer
4. Drag the circutpython image to the device(find online)
5. Drag the code to the device, making sure the files are in the root directory
6. Voila

The cad files for the board are in the branch Cad-Files
